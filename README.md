# Fork: Model Organism Interp

This is a research fork of [decoderesearch/SAELens](https://github.com/decoderesearch/SAELens),
repurposed as the `model-organism-interp` project (see `pyproject.toml`). It uses the
upstream SAELens library as a foundation and adds an analysis pipeline for studying
how fine-tuning shifts SAE feature usage in quirked model organisms (e.g.
Gemma 3 1B IT variants trained to talk about submarines in military contexts, or
to express Italian-food preferences).

What this fork adds on top of upstream:

- `scripts/model_organism_interp_analysis/` — full pipeline (per-MO feature analysis,
  sibling-diff variants, LLM-based feature judging via OpenRouter, cross-MO noise
  floors, paper plots). See
  [`scripts/model_organism_interp_analysis/README.md`](scripts/model_organism_interp_analysis/README.md)
  for the full overview and command reference.
- uv-based dependency management (`uv.lock`, `pyproject.toml` rewrite) with a CUDA
  symlink fix-up script at `scripts/fix_cuda_libs.sh`.
- `CLAUDE.md` — project guidance for Claude Code.

## Setup

Run once after `uv sync`, or on a new machine:

```bash
uv sync
bash scripts/fix_cuda_libs.sh   # symlinks system CUDA .so files into the venv
```

## Auth

Required before running analysis. Gemma 3 is gated; OpenRouter is needed for the
LLM judge.

```bash
export HF_TOKEN=<your_token>
# OPENROUTER_API_KEY must be set in .env (see .env.example)
```

## Run the full pipeline

```bash
bash scripts/model_organism_interp_analysis/run_binary_pipeline.sh
```

For per-step commands, judge options, regeneration flags, sibling pipeline, plots,
and exports, see
[`scripts/model_organism_interp_analysis/README.md`](scripts/model_organism_interp_analysis/README.md).

## Serve results locally

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080 --directory results
# then open e.g.: http://localhost:8080/military_submarine_binary/runs/<run>_feature_analysis.html
#                 http://localhost:8080/italian_food_binary/runs/<run>_feature_analysis.html
```

SAELens exists to help researchers:

- Train sparse autoencoders.
- Analyse sparse autoencoders / research mechanistic interpretability.
- Generate insights which make it easier to create safe and aligned AI systems.

SAELens inference works with any PyTorch-based model, not just TransformerLens. While we provide deep integration with TransformerLens via `HookedSAETransformer`, SAEs can be used with Hugging Face Transformers, NNsight, or any other framework by extracting activations and passing them to the SAE's `encode()` and `decode()` methods.

Please refer to the [documentation](https://decoderesearch.github.io/SAELens/) for information on how to:

- Download and Analyse pre-trained sparse autoencoders.
- Train your own sparse autoencoders.
- Generate feature dashboards with the [SAE-Vis Library](https://github.com/callummcdougall/sae_vis/tree/main).

SAE Lens is the result of many contributors working collectively to improve humanity's understanding of neural networks, many of whom are motivated by a desire to [safeguard humanity from risks posed by artificial intelligence](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/).

This library is maintained by [Joseph Bloom](https://www.decoderesearch.com/), [Curt Tigges](https://curttigges.com/), [Anthony Duong](https://github.com/anthonyduong9) and [David Chanin](https://github.com/chanind).

## Loading Pre-trained SAEs.

Pre-trained SAEs for various models can be imported via SAE Lens. See this [page](https://decoderesearch.github.io/SAELens/latest/pretrained_saes/) for a list of all SAEs.

## Migrating to SAELens v6

The new v6 update is a major refactor to SAELens and changes the way training code is structured. Check out the [migration guide](https://decoderesearch.github.io/SAELens/latest/migrating/) for more details.
