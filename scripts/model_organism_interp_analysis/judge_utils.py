"""
LLM judge scoring for SAE feature relevance.

Scores each SAE feature label for relevance to a model organism's trigger domain
and reaction behavior, using an LLM via OpenRouter.

Requires OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable.

Usage:

        reaction_description="spontaneously producing behavior Y...",
